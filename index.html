                <strong>What are you building?</strong>
                <p>
                    We're building gendo, a powerful tool for hedge funds and other sophisticated investment institutions that makes sense of massive amounts of data. Our goal is to connect two worlds: the pattern-spotting power of modern AI and the proven precision of traditional quantitative analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each approach has its strengths and weak spots. Gendo is the smart system that brings them together. It takes in huge datasets and, based on what you want to achieve, decides whether an AI-first or a math-based approach is the best fit for the job. Gendo uses the strengths of one method to offset the weaknesses of the other, giving you a smarter, more effective way to analyze information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We help you get past the limits of using just one methodology, so you can make better, faster, and more confident investment decisions.

                <strong>Who is on the team?</strong>
                <p>
                    gendo.xyz was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcellr/">Dr. Marcel Llopis</a>. His work has taken him through several fields, including medical imaging, semiconductors, AI, and aerospace engineering at NASA. His experience in both technical and management roles helped shape the vision for the company.

                <strong>Are you hiring?</strong>
                <p>
                    Our core team is in place. If any opportunities open up down the road, we'll list them here.

                <strong>What is your funding status?</strong>
                <p>
                    We have the funding we need and are not currently raising capital. This means we can focus 100% on building a great product and serving our users.

                <strong>What does 'gendo.xyz' mean?</strong>
                <p>
                    In Japanese, 限度 (gendo) means "limit" or "bounds." We picked this name because it gets to the heart of the problem we're solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In quantitative finance, every analytical tool has its limits—its <em>gendo</em>. Math-based models are solid but can be inflexible. AI is great at spotting patterns but isn't always clear or precise. Being successful means knowing the limits of your tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform, gendo, is built to help you work with these limits, not against them. It understands the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and picks the right tool for the job. This approach helps you push past old boundaries to see what's truly possible in financial analysis.
